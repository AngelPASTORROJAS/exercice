```

The error you're encountering is due to running minikube with root privileges while using the docker driver. This is a security measure implemented by minikube to prevent potential risks associated with running Docker as root. Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

1. Create a new non-root user if you don't already have one:
   ```
   adduser newuser
   ```

2. Add the new user to the docker group:
   ```
   usermod -aG docker newuser
   ```

3. Switch to the new user:
   ```
   su - newuser
   ```

4. Now try running minikube start as the non-root user:
   ```
   minikube start
   ```

If you absolutely must run minikube as root, you can use the --force flag, but this is not recommended for security reasons:

```
minikube start --force
```

Alternatively, if you're running minikube within a VM, you can use the none driver:

```
minikube start --driver=none
```

However, the none driver should be used with caution as it runs directly on the host system and can potentially cause conflicts with existing configurations[1][2].

Remember, running Docker and minikube as a non-root user is considered a best practice for security reasons[3][4].
